Todo:

X Create single app to start proxy + router

X Use UDP mcast to find local routers

X Merge bouncer into proxy 
    
X  Proxy should retry connecting to unreachable proxies (may be passed 
   by user and not ready yet).  

  Create Factory for service links 

  Add ssh tunneling to DirectSocketFactory

  Add TCP splicing to Virtual  

  Add support for multiple proxy addresses to VirtualSocketFactory

  Check if timeout make any sence....

Think about: 

  Think of smart way to use bouncers ? 

  Cache info in servicelink instances ? 

  Have multiple instances of VirtualSocketFactory based on properties ?
     
  Web interface to proxies to make it easier to add addresses ? 

  Make up unique ID for machines that only have local IP's (UUID ?)

  Add UDP/STUN like module to Virtual ?  

  Add parallel streams (where ? Direct ot Virtual)
