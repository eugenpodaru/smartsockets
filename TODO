Todo:

X Create single app to start proxy + router

X Use UDP mcast to find local routers

X Merge bouncer into proxy 
    
X  Proxy should retry connecting to unreachable proxies (may be passed 
   by user and not ready yet).  

X Add STUN support to DirectFactory to find external address. 

X Support multiple servers for STUN
   
  Create Factory for service links 

  Add TCP splicing to Virtual  

  Add support for multiple proxy addresses to VirtualSocketFactory

  Check if timeout make any sence....
  
  Icing on cake: have the VirtualSocket transparently move from Routed 
                  to splice/stun type connection....

Think about: 

  Machine may have multiple external addresses (multiple networks, each with NAT) ?

  Add ssh tunneling to DirectSocketFactory ? 
    - How do you known where to tunnel to ? 

  Think of smart way to use bouncers ? 

  Cache info in servicelink instances ? 

  Have multiple instances of VirtualSocketFactory based on properties ?
     
  Web interface to proxies to make it easier to add addresses ? 

  Make up unique ID for machines that only have local IP's (UUID ?)

  Add UDP/STUN like module to Virtual ?  

  Add parallel streams (where ? Direct ot Virtual)
