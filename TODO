Todo:

  Create single app to start proxy + router

  Proxy should retry connecting to addresses passed by user

  Create Factory for service links 

  Add ssh tunneling to DirectSocketFactory

  Add TCP splicing to Virtual  

     
Think about: 

  Web interface to proxies to make it easier to add addresses ? 

  Make up unique ID for machines that only have local IP's (UUID ?)

  Add UDP/STUN like module to Virtual ?  

  Add parallel streams (where ? Direct ot Virtual)
